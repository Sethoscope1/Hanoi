TOWERS OF HANOI - The game that brought a kingdom to its knees
===

Towers of Hanoi game built in Javascript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS
---

### Gems & Libraries

*  Underscore.js
*  JQuery

### Getting Started

1.  Open index.html in your browser

### Playing

The object of the game is to move the tower of disks to one of the empty spots on the board. You can only move a disk to an empty spot or to a space occupied by a larger disk.

*  First, click on the the tower you want to move. You can only move the top disk on a stack
*  Next, click on the space you want to move the disk to. If it's a legal play, your disk will move.
*  This board can be solved in as few as seven moves. Click away until you move the stack; you can't break it. It just might take you a while.

### Goals

This was a quick project to practice building things in Javascript, and to get familiar with Jquery.

### Credits

Most of the game was written in collaboration with Sarah Quigley - github.com/sarahquigley.
